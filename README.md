If your answer to the question is correct, you will receive points, and it will automatically minus the life points of the enemy and move on to the next question. When the answer is wrong, your life points will be reduced based on the points of the question. When the life point of the enemy has run out, you will be moving to the next level, but when yours run out, it's a game over
